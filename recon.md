# Recon

Whilst reconnaisance for a website is technically not a vulnerability by itself, recon is performed by the attacker to obtain more infromation and probe into the weakest link into the network. whilst that being said quoccabank can limit the amount of information it leaks as well as make attacker's lives alot harder by turning on settings such as the wildcard DNS setting. Furthermore, Quoccabank can look through the way back machine and close off any heritage endpoints that are no longer in use and may be poorly secured in order for it to not escallate into a vulnerability for the network.

## Methodology

The recon procedure employed on quoccabank is a combination of passive and active subdomain enumeration. Through means such as online scanners, using crt.sh as well as using dns enumeration tools such such as *altdns, amass, gobuster* as well as dns resolution tools such as *massdns*
